Thank you very much for your time examining and potentially modifying the source code. I truly believe it is what makes this community so great. This plugin wouldn't have gained the notoriety it has had I not opened up the original source and been quite unhappy with it.


Requirements & Best Practices
-

Just a few guidelines before submitting issues and pull requests:

- Ensure the code passes [JSHint](http://jshint.com) completely
- Always strive to write code that meets [best practices](http://taitems.github.com/Front-End-Development-Guidelines/)
- If you're attempting to solve a very unique bug, a test case is preferred
- Please target all pull requests to the [develop](/../../tree/develop) branch

And thanks once again!
